This angular exercise was an introduction to express and server creation. It allows CRUD functionality in adding bounty hunters. It then sends and stores them in an array on the server via Node.js, Express. Database storage will be implemented soon.

To run this app, you can run server.js in your terminal using node, and then open the web app by going to localhost:8000 in your browser.
