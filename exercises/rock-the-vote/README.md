Rock the vote was a full stack assignment. The requirements were to create a web application which allowed CRUD functionality with the ability to add posts on political issues, along with the ability to upvote, downvote, and add comments the posts.

For this app I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, AngularJS, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. This is one of the apps I enjoyed creating the most.


To run this app, you will need to have MongoDB running, and then run server.js(which can be done through node using the terminal).
