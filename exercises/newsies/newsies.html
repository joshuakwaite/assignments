            <img src="MoDeceased.png" id="moReeder">
            <p>V-school students, staff, and alumni mourn the death of Mo Reeder this week, who served as the school's Chief Marketing Officer.</p> In an untimely death, Mo was crushed by a falling piano while was traversing the dangerous streets of Salt Lake City.
            <p>Most will remember Mo as a kind, yet driven individual who cared more about others than himself. "Mo was a great man" - those were the words from Bob, the lead instructor at V-school.</p>
            <p>The funeral service will be on Friday.</p>

            <p>In a past life we founded Verisage, a custom dev shop building beautiful, world-class web and mobile apps for clients and friends.</p>

<p>In doing this good work we noticed that often, our clients would be in need of full stack developers to round-out their internal teams and scale the products that we were helping them build.</p>

<p>Enter V School, an institution focused on identifying people with high aptitude for coding and accelerating them through an intensive training program. Upon finishing this immersive education, this new wave of highly trained, full stack junior devs was ready to tackle projects for the dev shop, as well as pursue inspiring full-time work in a new technical career of their choice.</p>

<p>Our mission is to improve the human experience by continuing to modernize education, accelerating career readiness and increasing community engagement by providing platforms, training and tools to foster innovation and create economic opportunities around the globe.</p>

        <h2> Women in Tech</h2>
        <p>Technology is a wide rapidly growing market, creating jobs for hundreds of individuals all over the world. V School is happy to be part of this emerging job creation source; continually providing employment for our students at a 99% placement rate. Exciting news for everyone in tech, especially women. Though technology has spent years and even decades carrying a masculine energy and primarily masculine employment ratio, technology is getting made over.</p>
        <p>Women are breaking into the scene with more force than ever; creating products that no one ever thought possible in industries no one expected. The examples are endless; from basic development to high tech in fashion, women are coding success for themselves all over the world. A few of our fave women in tech crushing it are:</p>
        <p><strong>Kira Booth: Tech Lead at Qualtrics</strong></p>
        <p>Having only been in the industry for 2.5 years, Kira is making big strides in her career. Especially for a 24 year old! On her second promotion at this large company, she moved away from her original career in architecture as a draftsperson to software engineering because she wanted to find a path that could combine her mathematical skills and ability to think logically with creativity. Day to day, she meets with her direct reports, review bugs and feature requests, operational metrics such as speed and failures in our system, and most days she manages to squeeze in some coding.</p>
        <p>What is your favorite piece of current technology? The pieces of technology that make my job easiest these days are our homegrown internal service that provides real time dashboarding of my servers load, memory usage, CPU usage, etc. and Sumologic which is a third-party logging service which allows me to create and review dashboards that give me insight to what our customers across the world are doing with our product and to some extent what their experience is.</p>
        <p><strong>Lyza Nau: Founder of Girl Develop It! In Provo, UT</strong></p>

        <p>Her goal is empowering women in the field of Tech and teaching women how to Code, mainly because the support was not there for her when she was learning. Lyza believes helping women learn to code is giving them the power to change the world.</p>
        <p>What is your favorite piece of current technology? I absolutely love smart phones. I don’t know how I would live without mine. It’s like a mini computer in the palm of my hand. I love how I can make calls, take pics, record videos, access emails, edit files, surf the web and have apps for all types of things I need in my life! The Smart Phone is my favorite piece of current technology today!</p>
        <p><strong>Sariah Masterson: Program Director at V School</strong></p>
        <p>Originally wanting to get started in Social Media, she found herself in the boot camp space; creating processes for employees, running classes, sales, and conducting marketing. She was introduced to the world of coding during her experience at verisage when she was assigned some Quality Assurance work. She tested a few of Verisage’s client products for their developers and learned how to report bugs to developers and practice agile development. Her personal passion is women and girls and minorities — being a Hispanic Woman herself. She is now pursuing a Masters Degree in Cyber Security on the side.</p>
        <p>What is your favorite piece of current technology? The internet. Technology is a universal language right now in the world and it’s bringing so many of us together that never would have met otherwise. I think that’s pretty cool… </p>
