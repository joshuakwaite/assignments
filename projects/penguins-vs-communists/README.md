In this project we were to create a javascript file with two parties, Penguins and Communists, who would square off in a battle. Each side started with the same population, and a coin flip(randomly generated) decided which party attacked first.

Each party would attack for a random amount, and would then cede the offensive to the other party. This would go on until one party destroyed the other.

This is a project that is run in the terminal. It was created via JavaScript.
