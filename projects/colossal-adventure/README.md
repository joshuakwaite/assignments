The requirements for this project was to create a terminal RPG game in JavaScript that had monsters, an inventory, and a walking function. I also used the readline-sync NPM module for this project.

This project helped me solidify javascript basics such as for and while loops, switches, callback functions, and use of 3rd party modules.
