This project was to create a website in HTML and CSS for "Goomba's Pest Control". We were given an amount of pests killed and coins you get for each of those pests, and asked to determine the outcome via the website.

In this project I built an HTML site that took how many bugs were killed as an input and gave an output of total coins. This exercise was built to help with HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript.
